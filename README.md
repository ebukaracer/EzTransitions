## Setup
After installation, navigate to:  
`Racer > EzTransitions > Import Elements`\
This will import prebuilt elements included in the package to assist with scene loading, as well as creating and managing custom transitions.

## Quick Usage
After you have imported the packages `Elements`, navigate to the prefabs directory: 
1. Add `SceneLoader` prefab into the desired scene.
2. Optionally manage the use of transitions(while loading) in the inspector while the prefab is selected.
3. Quickly load into the next scene asynchronously, using `SceneLoader.Instance` from your script:
```csharp
using Racer.EzTransitions.Core;
using UnityEngine;

public class LoadSceneExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void LoadToScene()
    {
        // Load a scene by name
	SceneLoader.Instance.LoadSceneAsync("ExampleScene");

        // Or load by its build index
        SceneLoader.Instance.LoadSceneAsync(1);
    }
}
```

1. Add `TransitionManager` prefab into the desired scene.
2. Perform in/out transitions using `TransitionManager.Instance` from your script:
```csharp
using Racer.EzTransitions.Core;
using UnityEngine;

public class SimpleTransitionExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transition transition;
    [SerializeField] private float transitionDelay = 0.5f;

    void Start()
    {
        // Performs a transition(assigned in the inspector)
    	TransitionManager.Instance.Transit(transition, transitionDelay);
    }
}
```

## Samples and Best Practices
- In the case of any updates to newer versions, use the menu option: `Racer > EzTransitions > Import Elements(Force)`. 
- Optionally import this package's demo from the package manager's `Samples` tab.
- To remove this package completely(leaving no trace), navigate to:  `Racer > EzTransitions > Remove package`
